## **Crop Yield Prediction**

### **Overview**
This project predicts crop yields based on factors like rainfall, temperature, pesticide usage, and historical data, helping farmers optimize productivity and resources.

### **Features**
- Predict crop yield using machine learning models.
- Data preprocessing and visualization.
- Model training with environmental and historical data.
